<h2>What is Contra?</h2>

<img class="img2" src="stage1.jpg"></img>

<p>Contra, widely considered to be a video game classic, is a run-and-gun platformer released in 1987 by Konami. Initially an arcade game, a "home" version for console platforms, notably the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), was released the following year with substantial success. Among other things, Contra is infamous for its (at the time) highly innovative multiplayer mode and visual graphics, pop-culture inspiration, and insane difficulty. </p>

<p>Contra is either set in 2633 AD in the fictional Galuga Archipelago (Japanese version) or 1957 in the Amazon Jungle (American version). Both contain a similar plot that involves two commandos from Earth, Lance Bean and Bill Rizer, who are controlled by the player(s). Their objective is to defeat the Red Falcon, an alien civilization and terrorist organization whose goal is to conquer the entire world. </p>

<p>Contra was released on a multitude of platforms, with the most notable being its initial release on arcade machines and later, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Below is a table showcasing the platforms that the game was released on and a few accompanying details. I have also tried to partially replicate the second stage by using similar colours.</p>
